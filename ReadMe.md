# **TownVoice**Blockchain-Based Rating System ‚ú®

Welcome to the **TOWN VOICE** project! üöÄ This system ensures transparency and reliability for rating and commenting on public and private services like restaurants, organizations, and more. By leveraging **blockchain technology** for storing data and **Firebase** for auxiliary functionalities, this project offers a robust and trustworthy solution.

## Project Overview
This application is designed to:
- **Rate and comment** on services using QR codes.
- Ensure **transparency** by storing all ratings and comments on a blockchain database.
- Provide **administrative tools** to analyze data and view trends.

The system comprises three main components:
1. **Backend**: Powered by Go and blockchain.
2. **Public Client**: A React-based app for users to scan QR codes and submit ratings/comments.
3. **Admin Client**: A React-based app for administrators to view analytics and manage the system.

## Architecture
### Overview
Below is a high-level architecture of the system:

### Component Breakdown
1. **Adapter Pattern for QR Codes**:
   - Converts QR code data into compatible formats for the system.
   - Ensures seamless interaction with the blockchain.

2. **Repository Pattern for Blockchain Database**:
   - Manages interactions with the IPFS-based blockchain.
   - Provides abstraction for data storage and retrieval.

3. **Facade Pattern for Inter-Repos Communication**:
   - Connects the backend with public and admin clients.
   - Simplifies complex operations into user-friendly APIs.

4. **Visitor Pattern for Comment Moderation**:
   - Detects inappropriate or offensive words before storing comments on the blockchain.
   - Ensures data integrity and compliance.
